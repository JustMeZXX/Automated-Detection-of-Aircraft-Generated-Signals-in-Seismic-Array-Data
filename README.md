# Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data

This repo is the official implementation for [A Data-Driven Framework for Automated Detection of Aircraft-Generated Signals in Seismic Array Data Using Machine Learning]

### Demo
The demo is provided in https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/demo, please follow the instructions on demo.m to start the system. 

### Dataset
The dataset is uploaded in https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/data, please follow the readme file to get access to the data.

### Code
The code is released in https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code. The code implemented for this study consists of three parts: data preparation (data_prep), modeling training and test (model_py), and decision fusion and system evaluation (fusion_and_eval). Meanwhile, necessary functions are available in the same folder.
