# Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data

This repo is the official implementation for the our paper [A Data-Driven Framework for Automated Detection of Aircraft-Generated Signals in Seismic Array Data Using Machine Learning](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/doi/10.1785/0220210198/609341/A-Data-Driven-Framework-for-Automated-Detection-of)

### Demo
The demo is provided in [demo](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/demo), please follow the instructions in demo.m to start the detection system. As a prerequisite, please download and add [functions](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code/functions) to the MATLAB path before running the system. 

### Dataset
The dataset is uploaded in [dataset](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/data), please follow the readme file to get access to the data.

### Code
The code is released in [code](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code). The code implemented for this study consists of three parts: data preparation (data_prep), modeling training and test (model_py), and decision fusion and system evaluation (fusion_and_eval).
