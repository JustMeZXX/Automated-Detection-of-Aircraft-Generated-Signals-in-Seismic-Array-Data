# Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data

This repo is the official implementation for [A Data-Driven Framework for Automated Detection of Aircraft-Generated Signals in Seismic Array Data Using Machine Learning]

### Demo
The demo is provided in [demo](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/demo), please follow the instructions in demo.m to start the detection system. Also, please download and add [functions](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code/functions) to the Matlab path before running the system. 

### Dataset
The dataset is uploaded in [dataset](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/data), please follow the readme file to get access to the data.

### Code
The code is released in [code](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code). The code implemented for this study consists of three parts: data preparation (data_prep), modeling training and test (model_py), and decision fusion and system evaluation (fusion_and_eval). Meanwhile, necessary functions are [available](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Automated-Detection-of-Aircraft-Generated-Signals-in-Seismic-Array-Data/tree/main/code/functions).

### Bibtex
The citing information will be available once the paper is accepted.
