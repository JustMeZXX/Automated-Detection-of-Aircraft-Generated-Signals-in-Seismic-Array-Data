### Dataset
The dataset used in this paper can be downloaded from: [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13jOnlugcSmGpu27-i477cq_AxN1kuV3X?usp=sharing). 

The dataset consists of training, validation, and test, which are created from Julian day 135 to 152 of 2014. Since a modified four-fold time series cross-validation was applied in the experiments, the random-split training and validation sets along with the corresponding test set under different seismic stations are saved at the different folder for each fold split for easy manipulation.
